 # Movie App Development
## Project Brief
The Movie App is a fully functional web application developed using **Next.js** and **React**. The app allows users to explore a list of movies with detailed information such as title, epilogue, category, type, actors, and classification. It also provides functionalities for searching, filtering, liking movies, and adding them to a watch later list.

## Objective
- Display a list of movies with details such as title, epilogue, category, type, actors, and classification.
- Allow users to search for movies, filter by category or actor.
- Include functionalities for liking movies and adding them to a watch later list.
- Use Context API for state management.

## Project Requirements
- **Framework**: Employed Next.js for the front-end.
- **Movie Data**: Created an array of objects for movie data with the following properties:
  - `title`: The title of the movie.
  - `epilogue`: A brief summary of the movie.
  - `dateReleased`: The date the movie was released.
  - `category`: The genre of the movie (e.g., Action, Drama, Comedy).
  - `type`: The type of movie (e.g., Feature Film, Documentary, Short Film).
  - `actors`: A list of main actors.
  - `rating`: Movie rating on a scale (e.g., 0-10, 10-100, 1-5).
  - `keywords`: Keywords associated with a particular film.
  - `kind`: The classification (e.g., PG, R, G).

- **Features**:
  - Search functionality for movies, categories, and actors.
  - Filters for categories and actors.
  - Functionalities for liking movies and adding them to a watch later list.
  - Use Context API for state management.

### Project Setup and Basic Components

**Deliverables:**
1. **Project Initialization**:
   - Set up the Next.js project.
   - Install necessary dependencies (React, Next.js, etc.).
2. **Basic Components**:
   - Create basic components for the app (e.g., Header, Footer, MovieList, MovieCard).
3. **Static Data Implementation**:
   - Create an array of objects for movie data and integrate it into the MovieList component.
**Tasks:**
- Initialize the Next.js project and set up the development environment.
- Create reusable components (Header, Footer).
- Design and implement the MovieList and MovieCard components.
- Hard-code movie data for initial testing.

### Dynamic Routing, Detailed View, and Search Functionality
**Deliverables:**
1. **Dynamic Routing**:
   - Implement dynamic routing to navigate to detailed movie views.
2. **Movie Detail Page**:
   - Create a MovieDetail component to display detailed information about a selected movie.
3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Implement search functionality for movies, categories, and actors.
**Tasks:**
- Implement dynamic routing using Next.js.
- Create a detailed view for movies, displaying all properties (title, epilogue, category, type, actors, kind).
- Integrate movie data dynamically into the MovieDetail component.
- Add a search bar component and implement search logic.

### Filtering, Likes, and Cart Functionality

**Deliverables:**
1. **Filters**:
   - Implement filters for categories and actors.
2. **Watch Later**:
   - Implement functionality for adding them to a watch later list.
3. **State Management**:
   - Implement Context API for state management.
**Tasks:**
- Add filter components and integrate them with the movie list.
- Implement like and watch later functionalities.
- Use Context API to manage the state of movies, filters, likes, and watch later lists.
- Refactor components to use Context API for state management.

### Styling, Final Touches, and Deployment

**Deliverables:**
1. **Styling**:
   - Style the application using CSS and TailwindCSS.
2. **Final Enhancements**:
   - Add final touches to the app, including responsiveness and accessibility improvements.
3. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
**Tasks:**
- Apply consistent styling to all components.
- Test the app for responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility.
- Ensure the app is accessible.
- Deploy the application to a hosting platform.
- Prepare a short presentation or demonstration of the app.
